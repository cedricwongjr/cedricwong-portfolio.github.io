      <h1 class="HomeText">Cedric Wong Jun Rui</h1>
      <h1 class="HomeTextSmall">Welcome to my digital portfolio! This is a website I designed and built from scratch using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and it showcases some of the activities and projects I've participated in over the last four years. 
      <h1 class="HomeTextSmall2">My passion for coding began with Minecraft, a 3D sandbox game that I grew up playing. I loved that the game allowed me to be flexible and creative with how I wanted to play, and wondered if I could incorporate some of my own mechanics into it. I thus started exploring ways to modify the game by creating my own texture and data packs, marking the beginning of my journey into the coding world. Much like Minecraft, I love that coding allows me to explore my creativity and self-expression, as well as exercise my problem-solving skills. To date, I'm fluent in four coding languages — HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python — and hope to expand my skillset to fulfil my aspirations of a future career in IT.</h1>

      <h1 class="CodingTextSmall">This is a game that I am currently working on. The objective of the game is for you(the blue ball) to kill the "boss"(the red polygon). To start the game you press the 'i' key. After pressing the 'i' key, the boss will start moving. You can also move by pressing the 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys. If you press any of the arrow keys you can shoot in that direction, however you cannot shoot in two directions at the same time.</h1>

If you cut them in the right order, the melon drops straight into the rabbit's mouth and you complete the game.</h1>

      <img src="portfolio/minecraftW.jpg" class="CodingImg4">
      <h1 class="CodingTextSmallM">Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that I've been playing for a long time. One day after playing my favourite fan made modification to the game, I wondered if I too could modify the game like that. After doing some research, I found out that Minecraft was made using JavaScript. Thus, I taught myself the basics of JavaScript in order to make my own modifications. </h1>
      </br>
      <img src="portfolio/minecraft.jpg" class="CodingImg4">
      <h1 class="CodingTextSmallM">One of my most notable modifications is adding a completely new weapon to the game. I created a magic wand that summons a fireball which causes a big explosion on impact. The player can also upgrade the wand to deal more damage. </h1>

In assuming this position, I was able to hone my leadership and organisational skills as I was in charge of leading about 20 students at once. I was also responsible for the logistics of the CCA. This was not always an easy task to manage, but through this, I learned many values such as discipline, respect, and perseverance.</h1>
      <h1 class="CCAText2">One of my most prominent achievements is the marksmanship badge. This was awarded to only 5 out of 32 students in my squad for shooting excellence.</h1>

      <h1 class="VIATextSmall">I was part of a community service project in school, helping out at Orange Valley nursing home. My classmates and I planned, prepared, and held a carnival for the elderly there. After much discussion and deliberation, we came up with a few games we thought the elderly would enjoy. We then split ourselves into several groups, each in charge of preparing a different game booth. The booth my group was in charge of was throwing a ball at a target. We designed the setup of the booth, made target boards out of cardboard, and even coordinated with the PE department to borrow some plastic balls.</h1>
      <img src="portfolio/VIA/VIA2.png" class="VIAIMG2">
      <h1 class="VIATextSmall2">All our hard work came to fruition on the day of the carnival. Interacting with the elderly on this scale was a new experience for me, but I quickly learned how to best be accommodating towards them. Some elderly were wheelchair-bound, which meant we had to escort them around, while we explained the rules patiently to others with dementia as many times as they needed. Overall, we did our best to ensure every elderly would be able to enjoy the carnival to their hearts' content. We were thus heartened to see that they really enjoyed the activities we set up for them, as many of them kept coming back to play their favourite game booths again and again. From this, I was able to experience firsthand how community service can really make a difference in others' lives — even if only for a day, seeing how happy the elderly were at the carnival made the weeks of hard work worth it. </h1>

      <h1 class="CCAText">Outside of school, I also played Water Polo competitively. I participated in a few competitions such as the Singapore Water Polo League (SWP League) and Pesta Sukan. I greatly enjoyed the sport as I enjoy working in teams. Training was gruelling at times but immensely rewarding: not only did I see myself improve with effort and time, but being able to work towards a common goal with my teammates whilst having fun was an unforgettable experience. In my time playing the sport, I learned the importance of perseverance, teamwork, and resilience, and the memories I made with my teammates are ones I will always treasure.</h1>

      <h1 class="CCAText">I was a member of my school's Science Talent Management Programme. I was selected to join in Secondary 2 based on my excellent grades in science as well as a short essay I wrote on a science-related topic of interest. Over the course of the programme, I participated in many science workshops on varied subjects. Two of the most memorable workshops for me were the NanoScience workshop where I carved my initials into a strand of hair, and a Forensic Science workshop where I learnt more about how the police use science to investigate a crime scene. It was a very fulfilling experience as I was able to further my scientific interests and gain a deeper understanding of science beyond the classroom.</h1>

      <h1 class="SciTalent">As part of the programme, I had the opportunity to participate in the Science Buskers Competition. Participants had to create a skit or a presentation that showcased a scientific concept in an interesting way, and our projects were evaluated by a panel of judges as well as the general public. I paired up with a classmate who was also in the programme, and we came up with a 'magic trick' involving an hourglass and a beaker which demonstrated the concepts of centre of gravity and friction.
